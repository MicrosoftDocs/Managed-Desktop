# Privacy

Microsoft Managed Desktop is an IT-as-a-Service (ITaaS) service for enterprise cloud customers designed to keep employees' Windows devices deployed and updated.

It also provides IT service management and operations, monitors security and incident response, and user support. This article provides more details on data platform and privacy compliance for Microsoft Managed Desktop.

## Microsoft Managed Desktop data sources and purpose

Microsoft Managed Desktop provides its service to enterprise customers, and properly administers customers' enrolled devices by using data from various sources.

These sources include Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Windows 10/11, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. They provide a comprehensive view of the devices that Microsoft Managed Desktop manages. The service also uses these Microsoft services to enable Microsoft Managed Desktop to provide ITaaS capabilities:

| Data source | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Microsoft Windows 10/11 Enterprise](/windows/windows-10/) | Management of device setup experience, managing connections to other services, and operational support for IT pros. |
| [Windows Update for Business](/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb) | Uses Windows 10/11 Enterprise diagnostic data to provide additional information on Windows 10/11 update. |
| [Microsoft Intune family of products](/mem/endpoint-manager-overview) | Device management and to keep your data secure. The following data sources fall under Microsoft Intune family of products:<br><ul><li>[Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/): Authentication and identification of all user accounts.</li><li>[Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/): Distributing device configurations, device management and application management.</li><li>[Endpoint Analytics](/mem/analytics/overview): Analytical insights about device and app usage.</li><li>[Windows Autopilot](/mem/autopilot/windows-autopilot): Device provisioning and deployment.</li><li>[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/): Provides security services such as device security monitoring and security intelligence data.</li></ul>
| [Microsoft Managed Desktop](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#home) | Data provided by the customer or generated by the service during running of the service. |
| [Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/compare-office-365-plans?rtc=1)| Management of Microsoft 365 Apps.

## Microsoft Managed Desktop data process and storage

Microsoft Managed Desktop relies on data from multiple Microsoft products and services to provide its service to enterprise customers.

To protect and maintain enrolled devices, we process and copy data from these services to Microsoft Managed Desktop. When we process data, we follow the documented directions you provide, as referenced in the [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

Microsoft Managed Desktop's processor duties include ensuring appropriate confidentiality, security, and resilience. Microsoft Managed Desktop employs additional privacy and security measures to ensure proper handling of personal identifiable data.

## Microsoft Managed Desktop data storage and staff location

Microsoft Managed Desktop stores its data in the Azure data centers based on your data residency. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 data center locations](/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <ul><li>As of November 8, 2022, only <b>new</b> Microsoft Managed Desktop customers (EU, UK, Africa, Middle East) will have their data live in the European data centers.</li><li>Existing European Union (EU) Microsoft Managed Desktop customers will move from the North American data centers to the European data centers by the end of 2022.</li><li>If you're an existing Microsoft Managed Desktop customer, but <b>not</b> part of the European Union, data migration from North America to your respective data residency will occur next year.</li></ul>

Data obtained by Microsoft Managed Desktop and other services are required to keep the service operational. If a device is removed from Microsoft Managed Desktop, we keep data for a maximum of 30 days. However, alert data, collected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is stored for 180 days for security purposes. For more information on data retention, see [Data retention, deletion, and destruction in Microsoft 365](/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview).

Microsoft Managed Desktop Engineering Operations and Security Operations teams are located in the United States, India and Romania.

### Microsoft Windows 10/11 diagnostic data

Microsoft Managed Desktop uses [Windows 10/11 Enhanced diagnostic data](/windows/privacy/windows-diagnostic-data) to keep Windows secure, up to date, fix problems, and make product improvements.

The enhanced diagnostic data setting includes more detailed information about the devices enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop and their settings, capabilities, and device health. When enhanced diagnostic data is selected, data, including required diagnostic data, are collected. For more information, see [Changes to Windows diagnostic data collection](/windows/privacy/changes-to-windows-diagnostic-data-collection) about the Windows 10/11 diagnostic data setting and data collection.

The diagnostic data terminology will change in future versions of Windows. Microsoft Managed Desktop is committed to processing only the data that the service needs. While this will mean the diagnostic level will change to **Optional**, Microsoft Managed Desktop will implement the limited diagnostic policies to fine-tune diagnostic data collection required for the service. For more information, see [Changes to Windows diagnostic data collection](/windows/privacy/changes-to-windows-diagnostic-data-collection).

Microsoft Managed Desktop only processes and stores system-level data from Windows 10/11 optional diagnostic data that originates from enrolled devices such as application and device reliability, and performance information. Microsoft Managed Desktop doesn't process and store customers' data such as chat and browser history, voice, text, or speech data.

For more information about the diagnostic data collection of Microsoft Windows 10/11, see the [Where we store and process data](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule) section of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

For more information about how Windows diagnostic data is used, see:

- [Windows diagnostic data in your organization](/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization#enable-windows-diagnostic-data-processor-configuration)
- [Features that require Windows diagnostic data](/mem/intune/protect/data-enable-windows-data)

## Tenant access

### Microsoft Windows Update for Business

Microsoft Windows Update for Business uses data from Windows diagnostics to analyze update status and failures. Microsoft Managed Desktop uses this data and uses it to mitigate, and resolve problems to ensure that all registered devices are up to date based on a predefined update cadence.
