# Standard operating procedures

The Microsoft Managed Desktop service is implemented and operated by Microsoft in your Microsoft cloud instance where you might conduct other administrative activities. Microsoft is solely responsible for Microsoft Managed Desktop-specific setup, configuration, and operation.

For on-premises products, your organization takes on all the responsibility for managing setup, and configuration and operational activities.
