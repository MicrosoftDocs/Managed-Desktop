When your organization is enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop (the service), what does Microsoft do for you? And what are your organization's responsibilities?

## Microsoft Managed Desktop's roles and responsibilities

Microsoft Managed Desktop (the service) provides these key roles and responsibilities:

| Role or responsibility | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Mobile Device Management (MDM) policy management | Microsoft will apply MDM policies according to [best practices](/mem/intune/protect/security-baselines) and consider requests for policy changes. We'll also make changes to your tenant as prescribed in [device policies](../operate/device-policies.md). |
| User support | We provide a mechanism for elevated access to devices and for issues to get escalated through a support request if necessary. For more information, see [User support](../operate/end-user-support.md).
| Microsoft Managed Desktop service support | Microsoft will provide support to your IT department through a [Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations Team](../overview/support-teams.md). The team will support technical remediation, change requests, and incident management for the customer's Microsoft Managed Desktop environment. For more information, see [submit a support request](../operate/support-request.md). |
| Change management | Microsoft will notify customers, in advance, when changes need to be made to their Microsoft Managed Desktop environment. For more information, see [service changes and communication](../overview/service-changes-communication.md). |
| Security monitoring | Microsoft will monitor your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If the [Microsoft Managed Desktop Security Operations Center (SOC) team](../overview/support-teams.md#security-operations-center-team) detects a threat, we'll notify you, isolate the device, and rectify the issue remotely. For more information, see [Security](../overview/security-technologies.md). |

No membership or configuration changes are allowed for these groups. Altering these groups can lead to unexpected configuration of devices and loss of functionality. For any issues or questions around these groups once established, IT administrators can [submit a support request](../operate/support-request.md). |
| Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise configuration and management | For [apps provided by Microsoft](../prepare/apps.md#apps-provided-by-microsoft) (Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise comprising Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Publisher, Access, Teams, and OneNote), Microsoft will provide configuration for the deployment, update, and support.
