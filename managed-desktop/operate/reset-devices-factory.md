# Reset devices with a factory reset

The Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations team can perform a factory reset of devices enrolled in the service when required. Resetting is helpful if you need to give a device to a different employee, or if an employee leaves your company.

There are a few requirements:

- Your global administrator must submit a [support request](../operate/support-request.md).
    - After receiving your global administrator's consent, the [Microsoft Managed Desktop Security Operations Team](../overview/support-teams.md#security-operations-center-team) can submit the request on your behalf. Include the device's computer name in the request.
- The user account must be in the Microsoft Entra ID before we reset the device.

[Microsoft Managed Desktop Operations Team](../overview/support-teams.md#service-engineering-team) will:

- Look up the device name in Microsoft Intune.
- Send the factory reset command to the device.

> [!NOTE]
> Do **not** remove the user account from Microsoft Entra ID before the device is reset. If the user isn't in Microsoft Entra ID, Intune can't send the factory reset command to the device.

When the device has been reset, you can give it to a different person in your organization. None of the previous user's data or enterprise data will be on the device. The next user will go through the same process that the previous person did with a new Microsoft Managed Desktop device.

The device will boot into the "out of box experience," and all preinstalled applications and settings will be applied again. The new user of the device must provide initial setup information again.

BitLocker is a key component of data security in this process. With BitLocker encryption on Microsoft Managed Desktop devices, data on the drive remains secure even after the device has been factory-reset. Any data that was on the drive won't be available to the next user of the device. For more information, see [BitLocker overview](/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) and [factory reset of a device](/intune/remote-actions/devices-wipe#factory-reset-a-device).
