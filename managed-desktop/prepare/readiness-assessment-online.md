# Run the online readiness assessment tool

## Step 1: Run the online readiness assessment tool for management settings

The [online tool](https://aka.ms/mmdart) checks settings in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), Microsoft Entra ID, and Microsoft 365 to ensure they'll work with Microsoft Managed Desktop.

Microsoft Managed Desktop retains the data associated with these checks for 12 months after the last time you run a check in your Microsoft Entra organization (tenant). After 12 months, we retain it in de-identified form. You can choose to delete the data we collect.

Anyone with at least the Global Reader or Intune Administrator role will be able to run this tool, but two of the checks ([Conditional access policies](../prepare/readiness-assessment-fix.md#conditional-access-policies) and [Multi-factor authentication](../prepare/readiness-assessment-fix.md#multi-factor-authentication)) require extra permissions.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The online readiness assessment tool helps you check your readiness to enroll in Microsoft Managed Desktop for the first time. If your organization is already enrolled in Microsoft Managed Desktop, don't use this tool.

## Step 2: Review the management setting results

For each of the following checks, the online readiness tool will report one of four possible results:

| Result | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| Ready | No action is required before you complete enrollment. |
| Advisory | Follow the steps in the tool for the best experience with enrollment and for users. <br><br> You *can* complete enrollment, but you must fix these issues before you deploy your first device. |
| Not ready | **Enrollment will fail** if you don't fix these issues. <br><br> Follow the steps in the tool to resolve them. |
| Error | The Microsoft Entra role you're using doesn't have sufficient permission to run this check. |

### Microsoft Intune settings

The following are the Microsoft Intune settings:

| Check | Description |
