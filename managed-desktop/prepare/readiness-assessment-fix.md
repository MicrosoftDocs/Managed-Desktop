# Fix issues found by the readiness assessment tool

For each check, the tool will report one of four possible results:

| Result  | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| Ready | No action is required before completing enrollment. |
| Advisory | Follow the steps in the tool or this article for the best experience with enrollment and for users. <br><br> You *can* complete enrollment, but you must fix these issues before you deploy your first device. |
| Not ready | **Enrollment will fail if you don't fix these issues.** <br><br> Follow the steps in the tool or this article to resolve them. |
| Error | The Microsoft Entra role you're using doesn't have sufficient permission to run this check or your tenant isn't properly licensed for Microsoft Intune. |

> [!NOTE]
> The results reported by this tool reflect the status of your settings only at the time that you ran it. If you make changes later to policies in Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Entra ID, or Microsoft 365, items that were "Ready" can become "Not ready." To avoid problems with Microsoft Managed Desktop operations, check the specific settings described in this article before you add or change any policies.

## Microsoft Intune settings

Access the Intune settings in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

### Autopilot deployment profile

You shouldn't have any existing Autopilot profiles that include or target-assigned or dynamic groups with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. Microsoft Managed Desktop uses Autopilot to configure new devices. If you have an existing Autopilot deployment profile, the **Convert all targeted devices to Autopilot** setting must be set to **No** for the Microsoft Managed Desktop Autopilot readiness test to succeed.

| Result  | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| Not ready | You have an Autopilot profile that is assigned to all devices. <br><br> For more information, see [Enroll Windows devices in Intune by using Windows Autopilot](/mem/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot). After Microsoft Managed Desktop enrollment, set your Autopilot policy to exclude the **Modern Workplace Devices - All** Microsoft Entra group.
| Advisory | Make sure that your Autopilot profiles target an assigned or dynamic Microsoft Entra group that doesn't include Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. <br><br> For more information, see [Enroll Windows devices in Intune by using Windows Autopilot](/mem/autopilot/enrollment-autopilot). After Microsoft Managed Desktop enrollment, set your Autopilot profiles to exclude the **Modern Workplace Devices - All** Microsoft Entra group. |

### Certificate connectors

If you have any certificate connectors that will be used by the devices you want to enroll in Microsoft Managed Desktop, the connectors shouldn't have any errors. Only one of the following advisories will apply to your situation. Check the advisories carefully.

| Result  | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| Advisory | No certificate connectors are present. It's possible you don't need any connectors, but you should evaluate whether you might need some for network connectivity on your Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. <br><br> For more information, see [Prepare certificates and network profiles for Microsoft Managed Desktop](../prepare/certs-wifi-lan.md). |
| Advisory | At least one certificate connector has an error. If you need this connector for providing certificates to Microsoft Managed Desktop devices, you must resolve the error. <br><br> For more information, see [Prepare certificates and network profiles for Microsoft Managed Desktop](../prepare/certs-wifi-lan.md). |
| Advisory | You have at least one certificate connector, and no errors are reported. However, in preparation for deployment, you might need to create a profile to reuse the connector for Microsoft Managed Desktop devices. <br><br> For more information, see [Prepare certificates and network profiles for Microsoft Managed Desktop](../prepare/certs-wifi-lan.md). |

### Company Portal

Microsoft Managed Desktop requires that IT administrators install Intune Company Portal for their users with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices.

| Result  | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| Advisory | You donâ€™t have the Company Portal application available in your tenant. Microsoft Managed Desktop will add it to your tenant when enrolling into the service, or [you can get the Company Portal from Intune using Microsoft Store Integration](/mem/intune/apps/store-apps-microsoft). |

### Conditional Access policies

Conditional Access policies can't prevent Microsoft Managed Desktop from managing your Microsoft Entra organization (tenant) in Intune and Microsoft Entra ID.

| Result  | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- |
| Not ready | You have at least one Conditional Access policy that targets all users. <br><br> During enrollment, we'll attempt to exclude Microsoft Managed Desktop service accounts from relevant Conditional Access policies and apply new Conditional Access policies to restrict access to these accounts. However, if we're unsuccessful, this can cause errors during your enrollment experience. For best practice, create an assignment that targets a specific Microsoft Entra group that doesn't include Microsoft Managed Desktop service accounts. <br><br> After enrollment, you can review the Microsoft Managed Desktop Conditional Access policy in the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). For more about these service accounts, see [Standard operating procedures](../overview/standard-operating-procedures.md). |
| Advisory | You have Conditional Access policies that could prevent Microsoft Managed Desktop from managing the Microsoft Managed Desktop service. <br><br> During enrollment, we'll exclude Microsoft Managed Desktop service accounts from relevant Conditional Access policies and apply new Conditional Access policies to restrict access to these accounts. <br><br> For more information about these service accounts, see [Standard operating procedures](../overview/standard-operating-procedures.md). |
| Error | The Intune Administrator role doesn't have sufficient permissions for this check. You'll also need to have these Microsoft Entra roles assigned to run this check: <ul><li>Security Reader</li><li>Security Administrator</li><li>Conditional Access Administrator</li><li>Global Reader</li><li>Devices Administrator</li></ul>

### Device Compliance policies
